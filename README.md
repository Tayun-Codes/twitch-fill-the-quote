# Fill the Blank
Integrating Twitch API for a chat interactive minigame! Inspired by Wheel of Fortune, Twitch chat can guess letters to fill in a quote, chosen randomly from a list provided by the streamer.

**Link to project:** TBD

## How to run it
Download a copy of the repo and run index.html in your browser!
Open the developer tools/the console and feel free to test it by sending messages in my chat at https://twitch.tv/parkypark123/
or you can use it in your own Twitch channel's chat by changing the channel name at the bottom of index.html
'''
ComfyJS.Init("yourTwitchChannelNameHere");
'''

## How It's Made:
Development was streamed live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/parkypark123/) on February 24, 2025 and February 26, 2025.
This was part of a 10 hour coding challenge made by myself to get over the fear of coding live and in front of other people.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and [ComfyJS](https://github.com/instafluff/ComfyJS) built by [InstaFluff](https://github.com/instafluff) to integrate Twitch's Chat API
Dynamic document element and attribute population.

## Future Features
Always open to suggestions, advice, and tips.

### React Refactoring
It was suggested that React may have made development easier... One day I would like to refactor this into react and see if that might actually be true.

### ComfyJS Node Package
InstaFluff has created an immensely capable node.js package with ComfyJS and I would like to take more advantage of the options offered there to improve upon this game.

## Lessons Learned:
Coding live is scary but people have so much fun watching your thought processes and love learning with you.
It's also super fun to debug live and have people celebrate with you when you finally find that one ".maps" instead of ".map"
Also super useful to pick how different people's minds work and try different solutions!

This mini challenge of mine has made me very excited to continue coding live with the support of my community.
